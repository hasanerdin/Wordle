# ðŸŸ© Wordle Clone in Unity

A fully functional Wordle clone built in Unity, following and expanding upon [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbcgqz5lM38&list=PLqlFiJjSZ2x39Qc0yj73Myixt8jmDUBNk&index=3).

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project recreates the popular word puzzle "Wordle" while exploring Unityâ€™s UI system, prefab workflows,  
and data-driven game design. The game challenges players to guess a hidden 5-letter word within 6 attempts,  
giving feedback for each guess.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
1. Type a 5-letter word and press **Enter**.
2. Letters will be color-coded:
   - ðŸŸ© **Green** â€“ Correct letter in the correct position  
   - ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow** â€“ Correct letter in the wrong position  
   - â¬œ **Gray** â€“ Letter not in the word
3. Guess the hidden word before you run out of attempts.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Systems Used
- **ðŸŽ¨ Canvas & UI Layouts** â€“ Dynamic grid created using Grid Layout Groups
- **ðŸ“¦ Prefabs** â€“ Letter tiles instantiated and updated at runtime
- **ðŸ“„ Resources Folder** â€“ Stores and loads the word list
- **âŒ¨ Input Handling** â€“ Captures keyboard input for letter entry and submission

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Creating responsive UI layouts with Unityâ€™s Grid Layout Groups
- Prefab instantiation and runtime updates
- Loading and parsing data from the Resources folder
- Implementing word validation and feedback systems
- Managing game states and win/lose conditions
